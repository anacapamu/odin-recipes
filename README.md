# Odin Recipes

The purpose of this project is to apply the concepts we learned in the HTML foundations section of The Odin Project. We were asked to create a website with a main index page and three recipe pages.

After learning CSS foundations, we revisited this project to change the font and colors. I decided to revisit this project one more time after completing the flexbox modules in order to make it look even better.
