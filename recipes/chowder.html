            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>In the mid 18th century, hundreds of French immigrants set sail for New France.
                While the trip started off well, after several weeks at sea it became clear that
                the ship would run out of food supplies well before reaching its destination.
                Unable to turn back, the crew improvised a solution; nets were deployed over the
                starboard and port, catching an array of seafood. The crew then boiled the seafood,
                and mixed it with the remaining supplies of milk and cream, thus creating enough
                chowder to feed the entire crew for the remainder of the trip.</p>

            <p>The operation was a huge success, and the ship arrived just in time for the crew to
                witness the British conquest of New France, immediately putting a damper on their whole arrival.</p>
