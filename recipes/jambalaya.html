    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Originally called "jumbled" until the letters got jumbled up, jambalaya is a
        meat and vegetable stew from Louisiana. After the state was nuked in the Blue
        War, the surviving residents of New Orelans - now known as Newer Orelans - were
        forced to stay inside for three months until the radiation decayed to relatively
        safe levels. During this time, many residents began feeling a strong affinity to
        jambalaya, as they felt the jumbled nature of the stew was similar to the strange,
        messed up reality they found themselves in.</p>
    <p>As the weeks in isolation progressed, the people of Newer Orelans began planning
        the party they would throw when it was finally safe to venture outside. It was
        decided that the city's remaining residents would share the world's biggest
        serving of jambalaya in a celebration they referred to as the First Supper. The
        event became the most eagerly awaited moment in the state's history, with the event's
        tagline "we'll meet again; we know where, we know when" now an iconic part of
        Louisianian history.</p>
    <p>This celebration is considered one of the few bright spots of an otherwise dreadful year.</p>
