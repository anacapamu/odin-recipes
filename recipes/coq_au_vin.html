    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>According to legend, coq au vin was invented by Julius Caesar, despite the fact
        that the recipe was not recorded until the early 20th century. It is therefore
        a commonly accepted belief that Julius Caesar set an elaborate plot into motion
        before his death to ensure that many of his close personal friends and advisors
        would carry on a mission to ensure that the recipe never be written down.</p>

    <p>While this mission was initially passed down from generation to generation, it
        ultimately became impossible for the descendants to dedicate enough time to carry
        on this ancient task and create heirs to pass it on to. Torn between two opposing
        necessities, the plan collapsed and the recipe was finally unceremoniously written
        down. </p>
